# Basic coffee tips

Coffee is nice, it gives you the boost you need to finish that essay of yours or sit through that boring professor without going to sleep during class due to sleep deprivation, but as nice at is it, it's actually way worse to use coffee the wrong way than not using it at all, I would go as far as to say that not drinking coffee at all is the best course of action, but in today's society that's now exactly...... possible, so before you drink coffee it would be nice to have the following things in mind about caffeine.

## The halflife of caffeine

You probably heard this about a million times now, but think about it for a second, on average, if you drink a cup of coffee **half of the caffeine that cup contained will still be in your system after six hours**, six hours after that and a **quarter** of the original cup worth of caffeine is still in your system and maybe even more if you are a less than average caffeine metabolizer, and that can cause you to have a bad sleep schedule or poor quality of sleep which is a topic of itself. To avoid that, remember that when you decide to go to sleep you should have **~50mg of caffeine** in your system around that time.

## Maximum recommended dosage

The maximum recommended intake dosage of caffeine for adults is 400mg, now that might seem like a lot but just a single shot of espresso is **64mg** of caffeine, that's just **30ml or about one liquid ounce** of coffee, and a cup of coffee has around **150mg** of caffeine which is almost half of the recommended dosage. Now, *going over 400mg is not the end of the world* but keep it as low as possible to avoid addiction or negative side effects with prolonged usage of too much caffeine which may lead to a higher chance of developing depression or having a hard time concentrating, and many, **many** more horrible side effects.

## Program your intake

Before you start the day you *should* calculate the total intake of your caffeine for that day and when you are going to take the last sip of your delicious coffee of your choosing so that you can get a good night's rest.

## Addiction

I still remember the day I stopped drinking **10 cups of coffee per day on average** which contained around 80 to 100 mg of caffeine **per cup**, I was a complete moron back then, but around that time I grew a frontal cortex and I decided to stop drinking that much coffee which was very easy actually...... **until the headaches came**, oh boy, the headaches were horrible and a common side of addiction. What I did to lessen the pain was to **take painkillers until the headaches stopped**, but when the headaches stopped I was clean of my addiction for good and I could return to drinking a **reasonable** amount of coffee again alone, or even better with my lads.
